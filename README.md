# ArduinoButtons
Inspired by jakecreatesstuff on tiktok, this was a little project for working with buttons and an Arduino Leonardo. Jake made a short tutorial on how to make a button that closes an application on your computer (alt + f4), so I decided to make one myself though mine closed the current tab open instead (ctrl + w).
Then using what I learned I added 2 more buttons. One to open new tabs (ctrl + t) and one to type out "slay" in fields that can accept text.

There are two versions for the codes of these buttons. ButtonVer1 uses the template provided by Jake and the Arduino library.
Once I got the first version working I decided to improve it by using a different approach to make the code look cleaner, which is in ButtonVer2.
Both versions provide the same outputs, just with different approaches.

The setup of my buttons:

Button1 (red button): closes the current tab open (ctrl + w)

Button2 (green button): opens a new tab (ctrl + t)

Button3 (yellow button): types "slay"
